<!-- 
Students: 
This file is the web portal for your work in this CITPT 111 course. This file
should be placed inside the citpt111 folder on your server space.

This is named "index.html" and must always remain with that name. Do not rename
this file for any reason! If you rename it, I won't be able to access your files.
If I cannot access your assignments, you will lose points.

You are free to modify this file as much or as little as you like, so long as
there are still links to your classwork from here

Every week you must add links to this file to each of your assignments. Your
assignment list will look pretty big by the end of the semester. Part of your grade
depends on if you correctly linked me to your assignment from this page.

If you're having trouble with this, email me EARLY IN THE SEMESTER so we can get
it resolved. After all, if your sink is leaking, fix your sink. Right?

INSTRUCTIONS FOR MODIFYING THIS FILE:
1. Enter your name in the <title> element
2. Enter your name in the <h1> element
3. In the <a> element:
	a. Enter your email address in the href attribute
	b. Enter your email address in the text between the <a> and </a>
4. In the assignments section, create a list item <li> for each assignment you upload 
   to the server. The list item must include an <a> link to that assignment. Be sure
   to test this link on the server and make sure it actually works. Broken links will
   result in lost points.
5. For each week, create a new <h4> and <ul> for your assignments.
